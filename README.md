# Fair Exchange System
CSC8109 Group Project in Cloud Computing - Group3

## CSC8109 Group Project Specification
### 1 Project aims
In this project you will:
1. Gain experience working as part of a software engineering team
2. Apply what you have learnt in other modules to the development of a cloud computing application
3. Evaluate the pros and cons of services offered by a specific cloud computing provider

You will use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) to develop a Trusted Third Party (TTP) fair exchange service. It is up to you to decide how you construct the service, and client, and from which of the available AWS services. Depending on **your design decisions**, you will most likely need some combination of the following:

- compute engine/services (examples include EC2, Elastic Beanstalk)
- storage services (e.g. Amazon S3, EFS)
- database services (e.g. Amazon Dynamo, RDS, Simple DB)
- messaging services (e.g. Simple Queuing Service (SQS), Simple Notification Service (SNS))

and possibly additional services. Do not restrict your investigation of services to use to the types of service listed or to the specific examples of each type. **You may decide to use other AWS services not listed above** (for example, there is an Amazon Key Management Service).

To review the available services you can start from the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) home page](https://aws.amazon.com/) and the services on offer as part of Amazon's free tier. There is also listing of AWS services by category (e.g. storage and content delivery, database, application services, security and identity). Take time to investigate the purpose of all products and decide on their relevance to the project.

The free tier provides a range of services for free for a trial period and within specified usage limits. You are not restricted to free tier usage. The School will cover legitimate group project costs beyond any trial period/usage limits.

The outcome of the project will be the fair exchange service and a set of reports on your group's work. In particular, in your group report you should evaluate your service and the use of Amazon Web Services with respect to the design decisions outlined in Section 3.
